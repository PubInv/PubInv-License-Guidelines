# Public Invention License Guidelines (v0.1)

## Purpose

Public Invention seeks to build a [free-culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement) public commons of inventions. 
Our repositories contain a wide variety of matter to usefully convey these inventions to the public. 
This policy is our attempt to follow the principles of free-libre open source software applied to inventions in general, and hardware inventions in particular.

In spirit, we give you the right to copy, use, publish, distribute these materials. 
If you make useful modifications and amendments to these materials, we ask you to contribute your improvements back to us and to the world under the same condition: that anyone who improves your work is also obligated to publish those improvements to all if they convey them to any. This principle is sometimes called “copyleft” and first expressed in the GNU General Public License applied to software.

In cases where copyright law does not apply, we ask that you follow normal academic ethics and etiquette by giving the authors academic credit by name for text, data compilations, theorems, etc. Do not plagiarize. 

## Licenses for Different Kinds of Matter

Material | License

Software | Affero GPL v3
Web-delivered Software | Affero GPL v3
Hardware | CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal
Documentation | CC0 (public domain) 
Scientific Articles | Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License
Freehand Graphic Art | Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License
Diagramatic Graphic Art | Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License
Regulated Medical Devices | Sunlight Regulatory License (WIP)


## Notes and Rationale
By making documentation CC0 (public domain), we hope to encourage maximum reuse and translation into other languages.

If a document is written in LaTeX, it is probably a Scientific Article, and should be treated as no-derivatives work to maintain scientific integrity. If it looks and reads like a publishable paper or the beginning of a publishable paper, we intend for it to be covered by CC-BY-SA-ND. We use the No Derivatives license for scientific works only in order to maintain scientific integrity (this is the normal behavior among scientists.)

If something was drawn by hand, the attribution to the artist should remain with the work (CC-BY-SA).

The best practice for diagrams is to include a copyright notice and license in small print in the diagram. For high-quality works we retain attribution to promote Public Invention; for low-quality diagrams we may use CC0/public domain.

Public Invention is developing a new Agreement aimed specifically at Regulated Medical Devices. It is an attempt to codify the spirit of free culture for medical devices.

## Overrides

A specific repo may specify a different policy. Individual files or works may override this general policy. If a file does not have a license, please assume either the repo license or this general policy.
A## ssignment of Copyright
Public Invention volunteers are expected to assign the copyright of work done on Public Invention projects to Public Invention so that in a copyright dispute there is a single copyright holder (Public Invention.) Public Invention will continue to attribute the work to original author where feasible.

## License for these Guidelines

These guidelines are licensed under CC0, to encourage you to adopt them for your own free-libre projects.
